# ETH Pool on Optimism

The first ETH pool will be available to KYC'd users only. KYC is completed by completing KYC on Binance and then associating it with an Opium KYC (Know Your Cat) NFT. [Full instructions are here](https://blog.zkbob.com/zkbob-x-kyc-know-your-cat).

Once you are KYC'd you'll be able to use the ETH pool on Optimism for private transfers of ETH or WETH without any additional limits. Instructions for using ETH and/or WETH with the zkBob privacy pool will be available shortly.&#x20;
