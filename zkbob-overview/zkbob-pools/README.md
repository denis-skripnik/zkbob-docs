# zkBob Pools

There are several zkBob private pools [across multiple chains](../basic-concepts/multichain-deployment.md). While most pools currently accept the BOB stablecoin for deposits, transfers and withdrawals, new pools are being created to support additional tokens. The first non-BOB pool will be an ETH pool deployed on Optimism, followed by a USDC pool on Polygon (BOB pool migration to USDC).
