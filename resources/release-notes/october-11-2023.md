## Release Highlights (UI)

### Payment link improvements

Payment links are an important feature for zkBob users. Users requesting private funds can send a payment link to anyone via regular channels like email, telegram, discord etc. When someone receives a payment link they don't need a zkBob account, and can use any token to make a payment. Improvements include:

1. Available tokens and amounts are displayed to users sending a private payment, making it easy to select and send.
2. Transaction confirmation has additional details, and can be downloaded by users.
3. Payment receivers get a notification once they receive payment from a payment link.
4. Payment link now supports both ETH and USDC pools on Optimism.

### Portuguese language support

zkBob is seeing adoption from users around the globe. Portuguese language support was added to the app, and additional language support will be considered in upcoming version.

### Message signing via ledger

A fix to support ledger hardware wallet users when signing messages in zkBob.
