## Release Highlights

### ETH pool support on Optimism

The UI was reworked to allow for multiple pools on multiple chains. The first pool to be released is the [ETH pool on Optimism](../../zkbob-overview/zkbob-pools/eth-pool-on-optimism.md), where both ETH and WETH can be deposited via different methods.

### Pending deposits display

ETH deposits use a different method for deposit (direct deposits). These can take longer, and pending display was added to provide users with additional information during an ETH deposit.

### Standards support for new token pools

Support was added to allow for new token pools, including support for the upcoming BOB - USDC migration on Polygon. `Permit2` and `TransferWithAuthorization` (aka EIP-3009) standards were implemented.
