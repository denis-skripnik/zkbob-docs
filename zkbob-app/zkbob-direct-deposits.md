# zkBob Direct Deposits

{% hint style="warning" %}
Examples are performed with BOB on Polygon. However, **the BOB pool is now a USDC pool on Polygon**. You can also follow the instructions to deposit BOB or ETH on Optimism.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
While there is a test application on Sepolia and Goerli, **we strongly recommend** using the application in production on **Optimism or Polygon**.&#x20;

If you need some live tokens to get started, please contact us through a supported channel (for hackathons use the official the hackathon [Discord](https://discord.gg/ethglobal) _sponsor-zkbob_ channel) and we will send BOB!&#x20;

## Direct Deposits Introduction

zkBob supports 5 different operations:

1. **Deposit** - Add funds to your zkAccount.
2. **Withdraw** - Withdraw tokens from your private account to a public `0x` address.
3. **Private transfer** - Make an anonymous transfer from one user to another with their zkAddress.
4. **Private multi-transfer** - Make an anonymous atomic batch transfer to multiple zkAddresses.
5. **Direct deposit -** Send tokens directly to someoneâ€™s zkAddress from outside the zkBob application.

The first 4 operations can only be performed by end users via zkBob clients, such as the zkBob UI.

However, with **direct deposits**, private deposits can be performed while abstracting away zk complexity. Depositors only need to know the private zkAddress of the receiver. This makes it very easy to integrate it into various automated web3 workflows.

Direct deposits allow any user, smart contract, or third party protocol to deposit any amount\* ([within accepted limits](zkbob-direct-deposits.md#direct-deposit-limits)) of pool token into the queue, which is then processed by the zkBob relayer in a trustless manner. The only function of the relayer is to include deposits in the state tree, providing a safe mechanism for deposits.

The relayer can process multiple direct deposits at once, however, users may need to wait some time - possibly up to a few hours - until the deposit is reflected in the zkBob account. [More on transaction types here.](../implementation/transaction-overview/transaction-types.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
For now, pending or cancelled direct deposits are not shown in the zkBob UI. Users will only see already processed deposits.
{% endhint %}

## Direct deposits

Direct deposits allow end users, intermediary protocols and smart contracts to make private transfers directly to the receiver zk address. Any EVM-based workflow containing one or more stablecoin transfers might be easily integrated with zkBob direct deposits on the smart contract level, with very little modification required on the UI side.

Examples where zkBob direct deposits can be integrated:

* Swap and cross-chain bridge aggregators
* Payroll and funds streaming protocols
* Donation / fundraising / tipping applications
* Vendor purchases
* Open-source wallets and browser extensions

## Direct deposits integration

Direct deposits can be easily integrated on the smart contract level using the simple interface (available at [GitHub](https://github.com/zkBob/zkbob-contracts/blob/develop/src/interfaces/IZkBobDirectDeposits.sol)).

### Creating a zkAddress for the receiver

{% hint style="info" %}
The most convenient way for users to generate a receiving zkAddress is to use the zkBob UI.  \
\
Open an account and generate an address: [generate-a-secure-address.md](generate-a-secure-address.md "mention")

zkAddresses can be [formatted in different ways](zkbob-direct-deposits.md#zkaddress-format) for direct deposit submission.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Submitting a direct deposit

Direct deposits are submitted directly to the direct deposits queue contract (e.g. [0x318e2C1f5f6Ac4fDD5979E73D498342B255fC869](https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0x318e2C1f5f6Ac4fDD5979E73D498342B255fC869) on Optimism, see [deployed-contracts.md](../implementation/deployed-contracts.md "mention") for addresses on other networks), using one of three approaches:

1. Common `approve` + `directDeposit` approach, suitable for a majority of use-cases. Available for all supported tokens.
2. Shortcut approach using `transferAndCall`, suitable for simple workflows. Available only for BOB token.
3. Shortcut `directNativeDeposit` approach, suitable for depositing native ETH. Available only for ETH deposits in the ETH pool.

{% hint style="info" %}
The  ERC677 `transferAndCall` approach is more gas efficient. However, it does not return the `depositId`. If you need to implement any post-submission logic in your application on the smart contract level and you need a `depositId`, please use the 1st approach.
{% endhint %}

Calling either of these methods requires 3 input arguments:

1. `fallbackReceiver` - regular user public `0x` address, which will receive the funds in the unlikely scenario that the deposit is rejection by the system \
   (**DO NOT** **set this address to zero or address that does not belong to the intended receiver**)
2. `amount` - direct deposit amount. A small flat fee is subtracted from each deposit to account for relayer expenses.
3. `zkAddress` - private zk address of the intended receiver, see info below for the supported address formats

**Polygon USDC Example**

```solidity
IERC20 usdc = IERC20(0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174);
IZkBobDirectDeposits queue = IZkBobDirectDeposits(0x668c5286eAD26fAC5fa944887F9D2F20f7DDF289);

// zkbob_polygon:QsnTijXekjRm9hKcq5kLNPsa6P4HtMRrc3RxVx3jsLHeo2AiysYxVJP86mz6t7k
bytes memory zkAddress = bytes("QsnTijXekjRm9hKcq5kLNPsa6P4HtMRrc3RxVx3jsLHeo2AiysYxVJP86mz6t7k");

address fallbackReceiver = msg.sender;

// Option A, through pool contract
usdc.approve(address(queue), 100 * 1e6);
uint256 depositId = queue.directDeposit(fallbackReceiver, 100 * 1e6, zkAddress);
```

**Optimism BOB Example**

```solidity
IERC20 bob = IERC20(0xB0B195aEFA3650A6908f15CdaC7D92F8a5791B0B);
IZkBobDirectDeposits queue = IZkBobDirectDeposits(0x15B8C75c024acba8c114C21F42eb515A762c0014);

// zkbob_optimism:CFiQ36Ghy3LRDFY7YmGvQE8nQaFGQmnbgorjFxDsDqKSdmfzUYtb6FTaWnHZBkP
bytes memory zkAddress = bytes("CFiQ36Ghy3LRDFY7YmGvQE8nQaFGQmnbgorjFxDsDqKSdmfzUYtb6FTaWnHZBkP");

address fallbackReceiver = msg.sender;

// Option A, through pool contract
// Note that ether is an alias for 10**18 multiplier, as BOB token has 18 decimals
bob.approve(address(queue), 100 ether);
uint256 depositId = queue.directDeposit(fallbackReceiver, 100 ether, zkAddress);

// Option B, through ERC677 token interface
bob.transferAndCall(address(queue), 100 ether, abi.encode(fallbackReceiver, zkAddress));
```

**Optimism ETH Example**

```solidity
IERC20 weth = IERC20(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006);
IZkBobDirectDepositsETH queue = IZkBobDirectDepositsETH(0x318e2C1f5f6Ac4fDD5979E73D498342B255fC869);

// zkbob_optimism_eth:Pny2VS1uphaJkHZdvfzhLdmruM6BMPSqyACzZkcUbJpmAe1hKwpi6Em56gKYsz3
bytes memory zkAddress = bytes("Pny2VS1uphaJkHZdvfzhLdmruM6BMPSqyACzZkcUbJpmAe1hKwpi6Em56gKYsz3");

address fallbackReceiver = msg.sender;

// Option A, through pool contract
weth.approve(address(queue), 1 ether);
uint256 depositId1 = queue.directDeposit(fallbackReceiver, 1 ether, zkAddress);

// Option C, through native ETH deposit
uint256 depositId2 = queue.directNativeDeposit{value: 1 ether}(fallbackReceiver, zkAddress);
```

Calls to either of the deposit methods can revert with corresponding revert reasons in case of the following scenarios:

1. Insufficient token allowance for `directDeposit` call.
2. Zero `fallbackReceiver` parameter.
3. Insufficient deposit amount to cover the implied deposit fee.
4. Deposit amount exceeding the single deposit limit for a particular user.
5. Sum of daily direct deposits exceeding daily deposit limit for a particular user.
6. Invalid zkAddress format/length/checksum.

The most straightforward way to test direct deposit submission is through the Blockscout UI:\
\
[https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0x318e2C1f5f6Ac4fDD5979E73D498342B255fC869?tab=write\_proxy](https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0x318e2C1f5f6Ac4fDD5979E73D498342B255fC869?tab=write\_proxy)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-19 at 10.40.32 AM.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Making a direct deposit from the Blockscout UI</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Submitting a direct deposit in most scenarios will require the end user to pay transaction fees in MATIC or ETH, which is not the same for regular zkBob operations.
{% endhint %}

### Checking deposit status

Submitted direct deposits are not executed immediately and instead are placed into the queue with `Pending` status to be later processed by the zkBob relayer.

In case your workflow requires any post-execution logic, you can request the actual deposit status from the pool contract.

```solidity
IZkBobDirectDeposits.DirectDeposit memory deposit = queue.getDirectDeposit(depositId);
require(deposit.status == IZkBobDirectDeposits.DirectDepositStatus.Completed);
```

### Refund pending direct deposit

In the unlikely event the deposit is rejected by the system due to compliance or AML reasons, a previously submitted direct deposit can be refunded back to the specified fallback receiver address 1 day following the deposit submission.

```solidity
queue.refundDirectDeposit(depositId);
```

### Request extra system information

```solidity
uint64 fee = queue.directDepositFee();
uint40 timeout = queue.directDepositTimeout();
uint32 nextDepositId = queue.directDepositNonce();
```

## zkAddress format

zkBob smart contracts supports 3 different zkAddress formats. These are identical to one to another with the exception of a small difference in their processing.

zkAddress consists of two main parts - a diversifier and a public key. More information here - [address-derivation.md](../implementation/zkbob-keys/address-derivation.md "mention").&#x20;

zkBob smart contracts support multiple address formats, which contain a different encoding of the two parts.

{% hint style="info" %}
The most convenient way to generate a receiving zkAddress is to use the zkBob UI to open an account and an address - [generate-a-secure-address.md](generate-a-secure-address.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

1. zkBob UI format (**recommended for Optimism**):
   * Example: `QsnTijXekjRm9hKcq5kLNPsa6P4HtMRrc3RxVx3jsLHeo2AiysYxVJP86mz6t7k` (simply remove the `zkbob_polygon:` human readable prefix)
   * Base58 encoding of the following string: `bytes10(diversifier_le) ++ bytes32(pk_le) ++ bytes4(checksum)`
   * Length of up to 63 base58 symbols
   * Base58 decoding is done on the smart contract level at the moment of deposit submission and is gas intensive (\~610k gas)
2. Pre-decoded zkBob UI format (**recommended for Polygon / Optimism**):
   * Example: `0xda9ee1b1b651c87a76c2efe3e4b9b0a0e53e5b66ed19ad100afe5289ea732bfd5ac002969523f26e6f2ff9ddd34b`
   * Same format as in the zkBob UI, but omitting the base58 encoding - `bytes10(diversifier_le) ++ bytes32(pk_le) ++ bytes4(checksum)`
   * Much more gas efficient decoding than the previous format (\~3,400 gas)
3. Raw format:
   * Example: `0xc2767ac851b6b1e19eda2f6f6ef223959602c05afd2b73ea8952fe0a10ad19ed665b3ee5a0b0b9e4e3ef`
   * Raw format without checksum - `bytes10(diversifier_be) ++ bytes32(pk_be)`
   * Most gas efficient decoding (\~1,100 gas)
   * Addresses without checksums can be error-prone and are generally not recommended for usage

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note the difference in endianness between encodings. Addresses coming from zkBob UI use little endian for zk address encoding.

Sending direct deposit to the incorrectly serialized address might result in the loss of funds.
{% endhint %}

### Checksum

zkBob address checksum is first 4 bytes of `keccak256(bytes3(pool_id) ++ keccak256(bytes10(diversifier_le) ++ bytes32(pk_le)))`

### Solidity Library

zkBob smart contracts use the following Solidity library for address parsing - [GitHub](https://github.com/zkBob/zkbob-contracts/blob/develop/src/libraries/ZkAddress.sol)

Use it to test off-chain zkAddress validation logic, or call read-only `parseZkAddress` function to convert zkBob UI address format to raw format&#x20;

## Direct deposit limits

All submitted direct deposits are subject to per-user limits at the time of their submission. Submission of direct deposits exceeding configured limits will revert.

Default direct deposits limits for all users:

1. Max amount of a single deposit - **1,000 BOB / 1,000 USDC / 5 ETH**
2. Max daily sum of all single user deposits - **10,000 BOB / 10,000 USDC / 5 ETH**

Limits can be adjusted in the future. Please refer to the up-to-date limit values displayed in the UI, or obtained through the smart contract interface.

## Direct deposit fee

Apart from associated gas costs for the deposit transaction submission, which is paid by the user, each direct deposit submission also costs **0.1** **BOB / 0.1 USDC / 0.0002 ETH** to process.

Fees can be adjusted in the future. Please refer to the up-to-date fee values displayed in the UI, or obtained through the smart contract interface.

## FAQs

### zkBob is on Polygon/Optimism, does that mean my app also needs to be deployed there?

We have production ready zkBob deployments on **Polygon and Optimism**, ideally your app should be deployed on either of those chains. Potentially direct deposits could be available on other chains as well, if properly integrated into one of the cross-chain bridges.

For testing purposes, we also support staging zkBob deployments on Sepolia and Goerli testnet. These are open for public use.

Read more about all relevant contract addresses for all networks zkBob is present at in [deployed-contracts.md](../implementation/deployed-contracts.md "mention")

### How to get testnet tokens in Goerli/Sepolia?

There are BOB/USDC faucet contracts available in both Goerli/Sepolia ([deployed-contracts.md](../implementation/deployed-contracts.md "mention")), which allow anyone to get up to 10k BOB/USDC per transaction using the Blockscout UI.

### Does a direct deposit operation require MATIC/ETH?

Yes, a native token (like MATIC or ETH) is required to pay the gas fees for a direct deposit transaction. In addition, a fee of 0.10 BOB / 0.0002 ETH will be charged for each direct deposit tx. For regular deposits, transfers or withdrawals within the zkBob application, MATIC/ETH is not required.

### How do I get started?

If you need BOB to get started (hackathon participants), please send us a message in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ethglobal) _sponsor-zkbob_ channel and we will send you some. We are also available for any questions there. If you are a developer, you can contact us via the [zkBob discord](https://discord.com/invite/zkbob).

### What is the address of the zkBob UI?

* **Polygon / Optimism** instance: [https://app.zkbob.com](https://app.zkbob.com/deposit)
* **Testnet** (Sepolia/Goerli) instance: [https://staging--zkbob.netlify.app/](https://staging--zkbob.netlify.app/)
